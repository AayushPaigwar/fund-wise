## Problem Statement

### Why have we decided to solve this problem statement?

If you live in a culture that millions of others around personal finance are a part of, especially anywhere outside main cities, it is very likely that investment and bank specifics can be confusing.

While people may have an idea of what mutual funds are and the concept of retirement plans, getting started is a different ball game. What suits them best?

We believe that everybody should strive to have a financially secure future. Because of this, we are creating a Financial Advisory WebApp which utilizes Generative AI to analyze huge amounts of data and make recommendations that are well-prepared. The advice will be available in the webapp for easy access.

We aim to provide transparent data and recommendations to help you choose investment programs designed for your target goals.

## Idea/Approach

- **24/7 Customer Support:** Responses to frequently asked questions and familiarizing users with basic financial issues and trends with the help of chatbots and virtual assistants.
- **Personal Recommendations:** Considering financial status, goals, and risk aversion, the system is capable of offering the most beneficial recommendations.
- **Budgeting and Forecast:** By gathering data and providing insights, the system helps to achieve anticipated future developments starting from creating a budget.
- **Market Analysis and Insights:** Prepare reports & insights on market trends, stock performance, and investment opportunities.

## Our Solution vs Current Products

While gaining popularity, Robo-advisors (like Kristal.AI) are a relatively new concept in India. They offer automated investment plans based on your goals but might not be as personalized as a human advisor or our AI approach.

We are creating a Financial Advisory WebApp that is powered by Generative AI for the analysis of large volumes of data and offers intelligent advice. Users can access financial advice directly from the webapp.

We provide bright examples and tips that will help you choose the programs of investment corresponding to your goals, assisting you in selecting investment programs that align with your objectives.

## Business Potential and Relevance

- **Personalized Financial Plans:** An individualized investment portfolio for you, taking into account your financial position, goals, and risk tolerance.
- **Efficient Banking Solution:** Satisfy your needs with FAQs, chatbots, and virtual assistants that are available to assist you.
- **Manage Finances & Skip Long Lines:** Manage your funds wherever and whenever, decide how you want to manage your investments, and where you'd like help.
- **Improve Client Engagement:** By using our financial advisory webapp, there will be more personalization, which will help to improve client engagement.

## Uniqueness of Approach and Solution

- **Personalized Advisory by AI:** We create individualized investment plans for you based on your financial circumstances, objectives, and risk-adjusted return tolerance. Providing you hyper-specific and context-aware advice instead of only basic tips.
- **Problem-Solving for Middle-Class Families:** Managing finances can be confusing and risky, especially if you don't have the necessary knowledge to navigate financial plans confidently. We are creating an easy-to-use web-app that will provide simple financial advice on all queries in your day-to-day life.
- **Personal Assistant:** With simple plain language recommendations and real-time insights, our webapp acts as your personal finance assistant, guiding you through decisions for financial success. If you need help budgeting, investing, or planning for the future, we are here to walk you through step by step using our personalized investment advisor.
